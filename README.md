Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are relational databases that store a patientâ€™s entire medical history in the hospital. From hospital admission to patient treatment and discharge, EHRs record and store various medical events that occur during a patient's hospital stay. While they are invaluable sources of clinical knowledge, exploring them beyond a pre-defined set of queries requires proficiency in query languages such as SQL. An alternative approach is to build a text-to-SQL system that can automatically translate natural language questions directly into the corresponding SQL queries.

The goal of the task is to develop a reliable text-to-SQL system on EHRs. Unlike standard text-to-SQL tasks, this system must handle all types of questions, including answerable and unanswerable ones with respect to the EHR database structure. For answerable questions, the system must accurately generate SQL queries. For unanswerable questions, the system must correctly identify them as such, thereby preventing incorrect SQL predictions for infeasible questions. The range of questions includes answerable queries about MIMIC-IV, covering topics such as patient demographics, vital signs, and specific disease survival rates ([EHRSQL](https://github.com/glee4810/EHRSQL)). Additionally, there are specially designed unanswerable questions intended to challenge the system. Successfully completing this task will result in the creation of a reliable question-answering system for EHRs, significantly improving the flexibility and efficiency of clinical knowledge exploration in hospitals.

### Data Relase

- The training and validation data will be released on January 29, 2024.
- The test data will be released on February 26, 2024.


### Data Format

For the task, we have two types of files for each of the training, validation, and test sets: data files (with names like \*_data.json) and label files (with names like \*_label.json). Data files contain the input data for the model, and label files contain the expected model outputs that share the same 'id's as the corresponding data files.
#### Input Data (\*_data.json)
A list of python dictionary in the JSON format:
```
{
  id -> Identifier of the example,
  question -> Input question (This can be either answerable or unanswerable given the MIMIC-IV schema)
}
```

#### Output Data (\*_label.json)
A list of python dictionary in the JSON format:
```
{
  id -> Identifier of the example,
  label -> Label (SQL query or 'null')
}
```
