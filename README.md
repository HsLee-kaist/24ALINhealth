Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are relational databases that store a patientâ€™s entire medical history in the hospital. From hospital admission to patient treatment and discharge, EHRs record and store various medical events that occur during a patient's hospital stay. While they are invaluable sources of clinical knowledge, exploring them beyond a pre-defined set of queries requires proficiency in query languages such as SQL. An alternative approach is to build a text-to-SQL system that can automatically translate natural language questions directly into the corresponding SQL queries.

The goal of the task is to develop a reliable text-to-SQL system on EHRs. Unlike standard text-to-SQL tasks, this system must handle all types of questions, including answerable and unanswerable ones with respect to the EHR database structure. For answerable questions, the system must accurately generate SQL queries. For unanswerable questions, the system must correctly identify them as such, thereby preventing incorrect SQL predictions for infeasible questions. The range of questions includes answerable queries about MIMIC-IV, covering topics such as patient demographics, vital signs, and specific disease survival rates ([EHRSQL](https://github.com/glee4810/EHRSQL)). Additionally, there are specially designed unanswerable questions intended to challenge the system. Successfully completing this task will result in the creation of a reliable question-answering system for EHRs, significantly improving the flexibility and efficiency of clinical knowledge exploration in hospitals.

### Data Relase

- The training and validation data will be released on January 29, 2024.
- The test data will be released on February 26, 2024.


### Data Format

For the task, we have two types of files for each of the training, validation, and test sets: data files (with names like \*_data.json) and label files (with names like \*_label.json). Data files contain the input data for the model, and label files contain the expected model outputs that share the same 'id's as the corresponding data files.

#### Input Data (\*_data.json)
A list of python dictionary in the JSON format:
```
{
  id -> Identifier of the example,
  question -> Input question (This can be either answerable or unanswerable given the MIMIC-IV schema)
}
```

#### Output Data (\*_label.json)
A list of python dictionary in the JSON format:
```
{
  id -> Identifier of the example,
  label -> Label (SQL query or 'null')
}
```



#### Table Schema

We follow the same table information style used in [Spider](https://github.com/taoyds/spider). `tables.json` contains the following information for both databases:

- `db_id`: the ID of the database
- `table_names_original`: the original table names stored in the database.
- `table_names`: the cleaned and normalized table names.
- `column_names_original`: the original column names stored in the database. Each column has the format `[0, "id"]`. `0` is the index of the table name in `table_names`. `"id"` is the column name. 
- `column_names`: the cleaned and normalized column names.
- `column_types`: the data type of each column
- `foreign_keys`: the foreign keys in the database. `[7, 2]` indicates the column indices in `column_names`. that correspond to foreign keys in two different tables.
- `primary_keys`: the primary keys in the database. Each number represents the index of `column_names`.


```json
{
    "column_names": [
      [
        -1,
        "*"
      ],      
      [
        0,
        "row id"
      ],
      [
        0,
        "subject id"
      ],
      [
        0,
        "gender"
      ],
      [
        0,
        "dob"
      ],
      ...
    ],
    "column_names_original": [

    "table_names": [
      "patients",
      "admissions",

    ],
    "table_names_original": [
      "patients",
      "admissions",
      ...
    ]
  }
```


#### Database

We use the [MIMIC-IV database demo](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-demo/2.2/), which anyone can access the files as long as they conform to the terms of the [Open Data Commons Open Database License v1.0](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-demo/view-license/2.2/).

Once downloaded, run the code below to preprocess the database. This step involves time-shifting and value deduplication, and more. 

```
cd preprocess
bash preprocess.sh
```



## <a name="scorer_and_official_evaluation_metric"></a>Evaluation Metric

The scorer for the task is located in the scorer module. The scorer (scoring.py) will report the official evaluation metric. More details are in the [Task Desciption](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/1889) tab.



## <a name="baselines"></a>Baseline


We provide three sample baseline code examples on Colab as starters.

### ["Dummy" Model Sample Code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZRhWr_o6-vyc0FKGAf1nuGZVycqyy-p-?usp=sharing)

Generates 'null' for all predictions. This will mark all questions as unanswerable, and the reliability scores will match the percentage of unanswerable questions in the evaluation set.

### [Local Model Sample Code (T5)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MmwWGcCIZ_B8ZQk761pehId1T7CYs5D1?usp=sharing)

Generates predictions using T5.

### [OpenAI Model Sample Code (ChatGPT)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OpmRjbHXO7u8_6_meCy_g-ukqSlZDanQ?usp=sharing)

Generates predictions using ChatGPT.
